    <p class="headabout"> About Millie</p>

    <p class="abouttext">I was excited to contribute to the world knowing this would be <br>
      the type of book men and women, young or adult could relate <br>
      to and gain the knowledge that they are not alone. To know <br>
      that they were not the only ones who have been sexual <br>
      assaulted or raped.<br>


      <p class="abouttext2">It all started when her dad retired from the police <br>
      force and moved to a small village outside of Accra, <br>
      Ghana. As a kid who didn't know any better it was there <br>
      where she was raped by a church priest, strangers, friends<br>
       and even family members. She believed the whole world was <br>
       against her.</p>
      
      
       <p class="abouttext3">She became homeless when her sister and her husband kicked <br>
      her out the house. She survived by having faith, hope, <br>
      and believing in the only person who she could rely on <br>
      was God. Even back then she knew there was a light at the <br>
      end of the tunnel.</p>
